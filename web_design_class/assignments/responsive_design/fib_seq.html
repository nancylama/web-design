            <h2>The Fibonacci Sequence</h2>
            <p>
                Two of the most influential mathematical ideas are the Fibonacci Sequence and the Golden Ratio, which are both interconnected. In the Fibonacci Sequence, every number is the sum of the two numbers before it, starting from 0 and 1. As the sequence goes on, the ratio between adjacent numbers gets closer and closer to the Golden Ratio, which is approximately 1.618. This relationship has been used frequently by artists and designers, as they have helped to produce aesthetically pleasing pieces by creating balance and harmony in them. 

                There are many naturally occurring examples of the Fibonacci Sequence, such as the growth patterns found in sunflowers, or the spirals in seashells. Artists and designers have used these patterns many times to imitate those kinds of organic designs found in nature. Pieces that utilize this sequence feel more aesthetically pleasing to the human eye. Whether we realize it or not, these kinds of patterns can be found everywhere in nature, making it feel more familiar to us.
                
                Like the Fibonacci Sequence, the Golden Ratio has been used to create beautiful pieces. A famous example of this is Leonardo da Vinci’s “Mona Lisa”, as her proportions follow the Golden Ratio. The placements of her facial features are divided in a way that follows this ratio.
