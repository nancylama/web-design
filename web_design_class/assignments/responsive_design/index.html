                    Math is everywhere. It is present in all of our daily activities, whether we are aware of it or not. But it is especially prevalent when it comes to art and architecture. Mathematics significantly influences what we perceive as beautiful and the things we create. It has been at the heart of artistic inspirations and architectural innovations, and has bridged a path between creative expression and logical thinking to create aesthetically pleasing and structurally sound designs. There are many examples of this, some being the Fibonacci Sequence and the Golden Ratio These mathematic approximations have been the inspiration of many beautiful artworks, such as those by Leonardo da Vinci those found in places of worship, and many many more.
